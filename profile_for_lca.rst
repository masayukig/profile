Travel/Accommodation assistance details 
---------------------------------------
"We have budget set aside to provide financial assistance to
linux.conf.au speakers and attendees who might otherwise find
it difficult to attend. Please provide details on why you
require travel and/or accommodation assistance in order to
present your proposed sessions. For travel assistance, please
also tell us where you will be coming from (country, state, etc)
to assist with planning."

I need travel and accommodation assistance to attend and give a talk at the
LCA 2020. Because it's far from Tokyo where I live and it's hard to get
travel support from my affiliation.

Where I will be coming from: Tokyo, Japan
